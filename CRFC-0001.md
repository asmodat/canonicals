# CRFC-0001 - Due diligence on the Notes App 

### Overview

This is my due diligence and research on one of the "Notes App" in the polkadot ecosystem performed on May 7'th 2022 and submitted to the team for the comments.

## SUMI

Sumi as per its latest deck proposes four primary use cases:
* (notes) Wallet to wallet communication via notes
* (on-chain analytics) Wallet data aggregation and query
* (decentralized identity) dID, “Login with Sumi”
* (web hosting) Static page hosting

Out of those four, only the last one/two offer to tap into real pre-existing demand for consuming content and interacting with the decentralized network. The goal would be to slightly reorganize the delivery route to prioritize those deliverables and potentially extend the roadmap with features which can nurture the project to have a larger vision in the scope of pre-existing large brands such as “Next Google”, “Next Amazon” to boost the valuation in the eyes of investors and further late majority. Second reason for reorganizing the roadmap is to prioritize in the eyes of consumers what the project represents as the larger idea.

Currently the static page website hosting has the largest potential customer base of all currently proposed points on the Sumi roadmap. As of today publishing a static page on IPFS, and especially multi-file static page hosting is not trivial while the throughput of the public IPFS gateways is limited making it a huge challenge in practice. Sumi could offer decentralized, potentially censorship resistant static data and page hosting without limiting throughput and access.

Some additional ideas regarding monetization:
* Offer free single page hosting, but require staking for multi-page
* Offer free page hosting but embed the add ons and monetize them
* Offer free data and page hosting but limit thruput depending on stake

Note that it would be a really good demonstration of the technology to host the Sumi frontend using Sumi website hosting itself.

With the website hosting Sumi could drift towards offering access to become uncensorable, decentralized search engine (rather than on-chain analytics platform) in order to access the largest internet user base in existence, with the initial target clients being those who look for uncensored & not curated search results to further expand it towards more consumer & kids friendly curated, globally legal & compliant platform. The currently proposed Sumi on-chain analytics is a very niche use case and could be a part of the much later considerations on the roadmap and only once the larger consumer base is established. Given that services such as DuckDuckGo are no longer offering high quality, uncensored access to the internet, Sumi could utilize that opportunity and create a much stronger brand picture.

One of the largest issues is currently access to historical website content and trust in integrity of that content over time. The currently existing WebArchive is cumbersome & unfriendly to use while the data provided by the platform can’t be trusted. By utilizing Sumi static page hosting users could preserve the infinite content of the WWW they browse and create demand for the Sumi token. Chrome-addon could be created allowing Sumi to both track user activity as well as instantly/one-click snap the websites they visit. In the case where the link is not accessible or expired the historical version of the page could be instantly shown. Users could also preview historical versions of the website. Inspiration here could be following addon with 100’000+ active users: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/wayback-machine/fpnmgdkabkmnadcjpehmlllkndpkmiak?hl=en-US

## Monetization ideas

Staking tokens to preserve historical internet links could be a marketplace where larger staking rewards are credited to those who preserve content of pages with high interest. Users could have limited credit for saving history with a requirement to stake in order to increase quota. 

Currently the largest technological limitation of Sumi is storing key-value references to data on-chain, instead a distributed hash table DHT could be utilized which offers both decentralization and fault tolerance. Utilizing blockchain for all non payment/staking related operations would heavily increase risk of the full-nodes downtime uptime due to high utilization of the RPC queries. It would be much more beneficial to offload data reference storage into separate, distributed protocol with a controlled number of index replications rather than forcing all full nodes to preserve all information on-chain. Even for the purpose of note sharing which is an original Sumi idea the DHT could provide a much more chat-like, instant access to the content without block-size limitations. To finalize each collator could potentially run a DHT related processes, indexing and other components so that the platform can be fully decentralized, fast, accessible and inspire trust in the eyes of consumers. 

One of the greatest flaws of all distributed storage systems is monetizing of the wrong primitives. Storage of data is most often gate-kept using tokens while being the lowest cost in the system. It is the streaming of data and limited bandwidth that in reality must be rate limited. Staking of tokens can be used as means of rate limiting while enabling public access to files for anyone globally even if they do not own any tokens thus exponentially boosting use and enabling quick saturation of the system.

## Suggestions

Storing messages on-chain is a highly inefficient way of communication. Since messages can vary in their size from couple of bytes to megabytes and even the hashes of the messages (typically 32 bytes) in some case exceed the size of the most commonly sent messages (eg. "Hello", "OK", "How are you") it is much more reasonable to utilize DHT as a redundant database.

Storing files in the DHT is the most common way of creating distributes storage platforms, example of the most popular being Torrents, IPFS. The main limitation of those systems is however ease of access. While IPFS offers set of endpoints to communicate with gateways the interfaces and their constant changes pose great difficulty for developers to perform integrations and maintain their applications. Since most applications utilizing online storage platforms already support AWS S3 it is much more reasonable to replicate the same exact API and CLI interfaces enabling instant integrations with millions of pre-existing systems.
